# 8. Potential improvements

Date: 2020-06-04

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Potential improvements for the future:
- Introduce list of supported values & reject unknown values before calling API,
- Functional/Integration tests (watch out for API daily limits),
- Caching rates,
- Return domain objects from services instead of Maps (richer domain language, more independence of the domain),
- Code style verification during build process,
- Better error objects (using default now),
- Logging.

## Decision

Not implementing as of now, during lack of time.
