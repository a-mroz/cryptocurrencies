# 6. Architecture style

Date: 2020-06-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose architecture for the application. 

## Decision

I try to follow Hexagonal/Onion/Ports and adapters architecture. 

This might be an overkill for such small and simple application, but it's mostly for the sake of practice.
